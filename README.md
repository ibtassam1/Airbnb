# Airbnb Project

This was a deep EDA of the Airbnb data for 8 metropolitan cities to find out the factors that affect bookability of an Airbnb listing. We also looked at whether review scores of host played a part in this decision.

Since the code file is too large, it is not rendering on GitHub. However, I have used Nbviewer to display this file online.

This project was one of the two projects selected by UofC MDSA director for showcasing on the university data portal, Dataverse.
